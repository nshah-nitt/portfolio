### How I Work

**A system-first approach to frontend development**

1. **Understand the problem deeply**  
   I break requirements into layout, interaction, and data concerns before writing code.

2. **Design system & layout first**  
   Typography, spacing, color, and layout decisions are made early to avoid rework.

   Components are designed to grow with the product and team.
